# Employee-Performance-Analytics
My submission for FP20 Challenge 30
---

## üìå Introduction
This project was developed as part of **FP20 Analytics Challenge 30**, which focused on analysing workforce performance and its link to business outcomes.  
The analysis explores:
- **Average Performance Rating** and **Task Completion Rate**
- **Headcount distribution**
- **Attrition vs. Promotion trends**
- **Compensation structure**
- **Training impact**
- **Manager performance**
- **Business outcomes** and their connection to **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)** and **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**

The goal is to provide **actionable insights** that can help HR and business leaders improve workforce efficiency, retention, leadership pipeline health, and ultimately customer experience.

## üìà Key Findings

### 1. Performance & Task Completion Trends
- **Oct‚ÄìDec:** Sharp rise due to holiday demand, KPI push, and year-end reviews  
- **Jan‚ÄìFeb:** Decline from post-holiday slowdown, employee fatigue, and winter disruptions  
- **April:** Moderate rebound with Q2 kickoff and tax season business momentum  
- **Jul‚ÄìAug:** Lowest performance levels due to vacations, reduced staffing, and seasonal dips  

### 2. Headcount
- **Store Operations:** 2,840 employees (**41% of total workforce**) ‚Äî the largest department

### 3. Attrition vs Promotion
- **Attrition:** 15.20% (~1,077 exits)  
- **Promotion:** 4.19% (~297 promotions)  
- **Ratio:** 1 promotion per 4 exits ‚Üí risk of leadership pipeline gaps & higher recruitment cost  

**Departments with highest attrition & lowest promotion rates:**
- **HR:** 1.90%  
- **Logistics:** 2.28%  
- **Fresh Produce:** 3.94%  

This suggests structural issues: lack of promotion opportunities, unclear career paths, or inadequate succession planning.

### 4. Training & Performance
- **Store Operations & Customer Service:** Lead in promotions, performance rating, task completion, and training hours  
- **Training‚ÄìProductivity Correlation:** Positive, with **44% of managers** in the **High-Training / High-Productivity** quadrant  
‚û°Ô∏è Confirms that training investment drives productivity gains.

### 5. Manager Scoreboard
- **Metrics monitored:** Team Average Rating, Productivity Index, Task Completion Rate  
- **Top-performing manager:** **Nicholas Fitzgerald** ‚Äî benchmark for management best practices

### 6. Business Outcomes
- **Store Operations:** Consistently exceeded performance targets for 2 years  
- **Fresh Produce, Meat, Fish, Bakery:** Showing measurable improvement from targeted interventions  
- **CSAT ‚Äì NPS Correlation:** `r = 0.64` (‚âà41% variance explained)  
‚û°Ô∏è Raising CSAT will likely boost NPS and customer advocacy.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations 
- **Granularity:** Analysis at department level; location/role-level variations may exist  
- **Causality:** Positive correlations observed, but do not prove causation  

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendations
1. **Replicate Store Operations model:** Training programs, KPI tracking, and promotion pathways across departments  
2. **Strengthen promotion pipeline:** Develop career ladders and succession plans, especially for HR, Logistics, and Fresh Produce  
3. **Compensation review:** Introduce performance- and tenure-based differentiation  
4. **Training investment:** Expand high-impact training to underperforming teams  
5. **Retention initiatives:** Enhance onboarding, recognition, and engagement programs  
6. **Link employee KPIs with customer outcomes:** Embed CSAT/NPS goals into performance reviews

## üèÅ Conclusion
The analysis highlights a **critical insight** ‚Äî while overall employee performance follows predictable seasonal patterns, **Store Operations and Customer Service consistently outperform other departments**, leading in promotions, training hours, and productivity metrics.  

This report goes beyond observation by linking employee performance to **customer outcomes (CSAT and NPS)**, confirming that well-trained, engaged employees directly improve customer satisfaction and advocacy.  

Leaders and HR teams can use this report as a **decision-support tool** to:
- Identify high-performing models (e.g., Store Operations) and replicate their success.
- Prioritise retention and career development programs where attrition threatens leadership pipelines.
- Optimise training investments to maximise productivity and business outcomes.

By acting on these insights, organisations can **strengthen workforce stability, drive customer loyalty, and improve long-term business performance**.
